## Introduction

Hey, I'm Chang Yang, a current senior at Eden Prairie High School and a development intern at Optum/UHG, aspiring to be a software engineer with a vision to create solutions for everyday problems. I've always had a passion for technology and dove deeper into that field in middle school. From developing games to coding apps to creating websites, there's a limitless potential for creativity. There's nothing as satisfactory as encountering issues along the way and then being able to solve that issue. Then, there's optimizing code for efficiency and reworking other parts to incorporate new ideas. Starting out, seeing error messages along the way was like the end of the world for me. Now, I see it as a norm as coding perfectly on the first try is more of an issue. Currently, I'm a web development intern at [Optum](https://www.optum.com/) working with databases, SQL and JavaScript. I plan to explore and become more proficient in more languages to maximize my potential.

# Projects

## Java

### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/ZeoShadow/Portfolio/blob/main/MineSweeper.java)

## Swift/SpriteKit/UIKit

### [Aero Clash](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/FighterJet.git)

This was my first project during my first semester of iOS App Development. My peers and I were interested in creating an arcade style game that had something to do with an airplane. Hence, we came up with Aero Clash, a fighter jet game where you take down enemy jets to aquire as many points possible to unlock new jets with different power-ups. My first semester was more centered on learning everything about developing and publishing an app on the App Store.  We started off learning the SpriteKit framework as it is essential for any game. Our first major encounter was when it came to merging our codes into a single functional game. Another major roadblock for us was figuring out sensors within our devices. Our game incorporated tilt control instead of the traditional joystick as we wanted to be more interactive. This led on to learning about the Core Motion framework. Both of these issues were resolved hastily within a few days of experimenting and researching.

As we progressed in the development of the game, I started shifting towards more of an App Manager role. This meant that I also took on the responsibility of making sure we had certain things finished on time so that we were ready to publish the app by that summer. I worked with a graphic artist to get certain sprites that were neccesary and handled other aspects before publishing such as the website and previews. After many tweaks and bug fixes, the app was eventually approved and published on the App Store. Looking back, it was quite the learning experience.

### [Find My EP](https://github.com/sarthyparty/Find-My-EP.git)

I wanted to create a resourceful app that would help incoming freshmans and transfer students nagivate their way throughout EPHS. Our school consist of several floors and countless hallways that would easily have people lost. I could recall students asking teachers on several occasions just to get from one class to another. Together with a few peers, we decided to develop an app that would serve to help those students navigate alongside announcements and other handy features. 

During the first semester of Advanced iOS, we started on building the foundations of the app, a GPS. As a developer, I mainly worked on UI debugging and design. As an App Manager, I keep my peers in check and make sure that we are consistently pushing updates and debugging issues that pop up along the way. I mostly worked on getting the dropdown search menu to function properly and transitioned to mapping out points on the floor plan.
